# Anomaly Detection

## This repository contains Codeup Data Science Exercises regarding eperimentation with anomaly detection.

## anomaly_detection.ipynb is a jupyter notebook containing the primary work done here, examining access to the Codeup Curriculum over time to view any atypical activity (i.e. access to curriculum far past the graduation date of a given cohort).  This information is utilized to try to pin down users that are staff of Codeup and other atypical conditions.

## Other data sets and notebooks are included playing with other data sets and methodologies.  DBSCAN clustering, Bollinger bands, proportional probability, and other methods to view outliers utilized.
